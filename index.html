Hopefully you enjoy it! A few things I should say about the beer...<br><br>The IPA was made from scratch in an all-grain process known as 'Brew in a Bag'. No kits here!<br><br>The beer is suitable for vegans, but does contain gluten - sorry!</p><p>I made five batches overall. For the bottles, I used Pale and Munich malts and Cascade, Centennial and Simcoe hops.<br><br>If you are trying the beer from the keg, the recipe is subtly different because of ingredient shortages. A small amount of crushed wheat was used and Challenger hops instead of Simcoe. It's also a slightly stronger beer - around 5.2%!</p><p>The bottled beer will have some sediment present. This is safe to consume (it is predominantly remnant hop leaves and some brewing yeast). To avoid consuming this, drink as normal, but leave the last 0.5cm or so in the bottle.<br><br>There is a small number of bottles that fermented differently due to primarily ambient temperature. I will mark these as LITE (this is a weaker ABV mini-batch that is essentially extra pale, but the same recipe as normal!) and SOUR!? (this batch I have mostly left at home as the fermentation completed too quickly. It is fine to drink, but may have an element of tartness that is not to everyone's tastes. Come and find me if you want a bottle of either, otherwise, I'm going to keep them until I run out of the normal bottles!</p><p>I hope you enjoyed the beer if you got the chance to try it and if you have any other questions, please come and chat! (I'll be wearing white trousers and a pink shirt).<br><br><b>And congratulations to Brendan and Sophie!!!</b><br><br><br>- Paul<br><br><br></p></div></div></div>
